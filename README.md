This repository demonstrates a common Dockerfile error: the absence of the application file referenced in the CMD instruction. The initial Dockerfile attempts to run a Python script ("my_app.py") that does not exist within the image. This results in a failure during the image build process. The solution demonstrates how to correctly copy the required application file into the image to resolve the issue.  The bug is reproduced by building the image using the original Dockerfile and attempting to run it. The solution can be seen by building the image using the fixed Dockerfile.
